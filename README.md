# **üìä A/B Testing - Marketing Campaign Analysis**

## **üìñ Overview**
This project leverages Python to analyze A/B testing data from marketing campaigns, evaluating the effectiveness of different strategies in driving user engagement and conversions. Through statistical analysis and data visualization, actionable insights are provided to optimize marketing performance and guide future decision-making.

---

## **üéØ Project Objectives**
1. **Understand Campaign Effectiveness**: Compare the performance of two marketing strategies (Control vs. Test) to determine which delivers better results.
2. **Identify Key Metrics**: Focus on conversion rates, click-through rates (CTR), and user engagement to measure campaign success.
3. **Statistical Evaluation**: Conduct hypothesis testing to validate results and ensure statistically significant findings.
4. **Optimization**: Recommend actionable strategies to improve marketing performance based on the insights.

---

## **üí° Business Impact**
- **Improved Decision-Making**: Provides data-backed insights to allocate marketing budgets effectively.
- **Higher Conversion Rates**: Identifies winning strategies to maximize user engagement and conversions.
- **Targeted Campaigns**: Guides audience segmentation and personalized marketing approaches.

## **üìÅ Dataset**
The dataset includes marketing campaign results with the following fields:
- **Group**: Control vs. Test group.
- **Impressions**: Number of times the ad was shown.
- **Clicks**: Number of clicks generated by the ad.
- **Conversions**: Number of users who completed the desired action (e.g., purchase).
- **Cost**: Total cost incurred for the campaign.

---

## **üìä Findings and Insights**
1. **Conversion Rates**: The test group outperformed the control group, indicating the new marketing strategy is more effective in driving conversions.
2. **Click-Through Rates (CTR)**: A higher CTR was observed in the test group, showing better engagement with the ad content.
3. **Cost Per Conversion (CPC)**: Despite higher costs, the test group demonstrated a lower CPC, proving its cost-effectiveness.
4. **Statistical Significance**: Hypothesis testing confirmed that the observed differences in conversion rates were statistically significant.

## **üî¨ Methodology**
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and ensured the dataset was ready for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized campaign performance using bar charts and box plots.
   - Compared key metrics across groups.
3. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Conducted a two-proportion Z-test to assess statistical significance in conversion rates.
4. **Recommendations**: Proposed actionable steps to enhance campaign performance based on findings.

## Hypotheses
### Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))
There is no significant difference in performance metrics between Facebook and AdWords campaigns.

### Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_A\))
There is a significant difference in performance metrics, favoring one platform over the other.

## Key Findings
1. **Engagement**:
   - Facebook achieves a **higher click-through rate (2.20%)** compared to AdWords (1.30%).
   - AdWords generates a **higher absolute number of clicks** (60.4 clicks/day) than Facebook (44.0 clicks/day).

2. **Conversions**:
   - Facebook has a **higher conversion rate (27.15%)** compared to AdWords (10.18%).
   - Facebook generates 11.7 conversions/day, while AdWords generates 6 conversions/day.

3. **Cost-Efficiency**:
   - Facebook has a **lower cost per click ($2.18)** compared to AdWords ($2.38).
   - Facebook delivers better value for ROI-focused campaigns.

---

## Conclusion
- **Facebook** is ideal for campaigns prioritizing **cost efficiency** and **conversion rates**.
- **AdWords** is better for campaigns focused on **high visibility** and **traffic generation**.

### Recommendation
