## **📊 Findings and Insights**
1. **Conversion Rates**: The test group outperformed the control group, indicating the new marketing strategy is more effective in driving conversions.
2. **Click-Through Rates (CTR)**: A higher CTR was observed in the test group, showing better engagement with the ad content.
3. **Cost Per Conversion (CPC)**: Despite higher costs, the test group demonstrated a lower CPC, proving its cost-effectiveness.
4. **Statistical Significance**: Hypothesis testing confirmed that the observed differences in conversion rates were statistically significant.
